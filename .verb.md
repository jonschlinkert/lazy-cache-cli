## CLI

```sh
$ lazy
```

Running the `lazy` command will do two things:

1. Add `utils.js` with `var utils = require('lazy-cache')(require);` and a list of dependencies from package.json
2. Add the `utils.js` filepath to the `files` property in package.json

**Options**

- `-f` | `--file`: Optionally specify a filename to use for the created file. The default is `utils.js`

```sh
$ lazy -f foo.js
```

## About

For those who can't sleep and/or would rather read this than do virtually anything else that would be fun and not this.

**What's lazy-caching?**

lazy-caching offers the huge advantage of only loading modules that are actually called at some point in the lifecycle of the application. 

**Why does this project exist?**

I made this for two reasons:

1. I keep forgetting to add `utils.js` to package.json, so this is my crutch. 
2. I myself am lazy. This lets me do less work.

**What is this project?**

This is a CLI for adding [lazy-cache][] to your project. You don't need a CLI for that really, since you can just `require` it in and start using it. But I like to add lazily-required module dependencies to `utils.js` file. 

**Why do you add lazy-cached deps to `utils.js`?**

The short version: I view this tiny bit of ugliness as a tradeoff.

> You're saying that you'll make my application faster whilst also allowing browserify and webpack to find dependencies, and all I need to do is add utils.js with some ugly code and temporary re-assignment of `require`? Sold. Where do I sign?

TLDR: I like to use temporary re-assignment of the `require` function to trick browserfy and webpack into finding lazily-required module dependencies that - despite being needed by the project - might never actually be called (depending on how the application is used or the options passed by the user, etc). Thus, browserify would not otherwise discover these lazy dependencies while instrumenting the code.
